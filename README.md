# CalcLyaTauGpu

This repository contains C++/Cuda scripts for executing certain calculations on a 3D grid data with GPU acceleration. 
Specifically, the code calculates Lya opacity in a simulated Universe, to be measured by near-furture surveys.
The calculation requires tremendous number of simple operations, making GPU an ideal machine for calculation.
I have confirm that my implimentation shared here is at least 100 times faster than CPU only calculation, 
and I am sharing the codes for people who are interested in doing similar calculations.
